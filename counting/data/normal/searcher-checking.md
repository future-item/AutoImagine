In this task, you are given a rendered image of a 3D scene from a specific viewpoint, and the name of the object to be found. You need to determine whether the target object exists in the image.

Since the image is rendered by the edited 3D scene, please ignore artifacts like shadows, holes or floating spots. Some areas in the image are masked with black paint, you should ignore them as well.

The last line of your output should be the result in the following format: ['found'] or ['missing'].
