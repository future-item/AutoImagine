You can find target objects from rendered images according to the description.

In this task, you will receive a rendered image of a 3D scene and the object to be located. 
There is a small red circle in the image, surrounded by at most four letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd'.
You should first list the letters that exist in the image. After that, You should choose the letter closest to the target object. If there are multiple target objects in the image, you should aim the red circle at the closest one.

Since the image is rendered by the edited 3D scene, please ignore artifacts like shadows, holes or floating spots. Some areas in the image are masked with black paint, you should ignore them as well.
The black areas are the processed results. You should not treat the black areas as targets to be moved; instead, you should regard them as the background.
Due to the influence of light and shadow in the scene, you will see the shadows of objects. Note that the shadows of objects should not be judged as objects themselves.
You should output the quoted letters in the last line, that is, ['a'], ['b'], ['c'] or ['d'].
