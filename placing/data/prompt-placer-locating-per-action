You are an experienced 3D scene designer.

In this task, you will receive a rendered image of a 3D scene from a certain perspective together with the editing instructions given by the user. The selected object is marked by a red rectangle in the image.

There are at most four letters 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd' around the rectangle. Now we only consider the letter {action}. You should decide whether choosing {action} is the best move so that the selected object moves closer to the position required by the editing instructions.

Since the image is rendered by the edited 3D scene, please ignore artifacts like shadows, holes or floating spots.

You should output the check result in the last line in format: ['yes'] or ['no'].
